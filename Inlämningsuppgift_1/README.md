# Assignment 1
The aim of the first assignment is to learn the programming environment and basic programming. These parts are about to save data of different types and perform operations such as comparing and calculating.
The tasks would print in the console by using **console.log()**.

### Task 1
All printouts should give the value, and you must only use the following operators once: **< > <= == !=**

```javascript
console.log( 5 * 2   12 );
console.log( 55   22 );
console.log( 16 / 4   4 );
console.log( 8 + 2   128 );
console.log( 32 * 8   255 );
```

### Task 2
Use string method to print the parts of these strings: **.substring()**
1. Print by ```"Tis""Tisdag"```
2. Print by ```"burgare""Hamburgare"```
3. Print by ```"be back""I'll be back"```

### Task 3
Combine the string methods, and to print the following parts of these strings:**.substring() .toLowerCase() .toUpperCase()**
1. Print by ```"LEARNING""It's Learning"```
2. Print by ```"good parts""JavaScript: The Good Parts"```

### Task 4
You should have the following array:
```javascript
var numbers = [128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048];
```
1. Create a variable named ```sumOfNumbers```, calculate the sum of numbers and print it in the console ```sumOfNumbers numbers```
2. Create a variable named ```avgNumber``` and calculate the average of numbers. Keep in mind to calculate average even though adding or removing some numbers. Print the average in the console. ```avgNumber numbers summan / antal summan / 5```
3. Add a number at end of the array and sum of all numbers. Print the new array in the console.

### Task 5
```javascript
var countries = ["Sweden", "Denmark", "Finland", "Norway"];
```
1. Print the first three letters of the second element in the console.
2. Calculate and average the number of letters for all elements in the console.

### Task 6
```javascript
var values = [3, 5, "Jane", true, 144, false];
```
Find out how you can reverse the array and print it in console.```values```

### Task 7
You will merge three arrays to a separate array, starting from the following arrays:
```javascript
var names = ["Jane", "Joe", "Eliza"];
var ages = [21, 34, 22];
var hasPet = [true, false, true];
```
Create a new variable named ```multipleArrays``` and print it.

### Task 8
You will merge all the elements into one string.
```javascript
var actors = ["Sherlock", "Watson", "Bo"];
```
With this array, you should print the result in the console with the format: ```"Sherlock - Watson - Bo"```

### Task 9
This if statement should contain three parts and perform comparisons against a variable named ```amount```.

1. If the variable is smaller than that, print in the console ```amount 50 "Less then 50!"```
2. If the variable is more than or equal to and less than that, print in the console ```amount 50 65 "Optimal range for the amount!"```
3. In all other cases, you should print ```"Too much!"```

### Task 10
You will use a for-loop and print the following. It is 8 rows in the example.

```
